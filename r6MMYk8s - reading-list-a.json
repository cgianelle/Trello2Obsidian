Reengineering is about innovation\n\n# Fundamental\n\nIn reengineering, businesspeople must ask the most basic questions about their companies and how they operate:\n\n- Why do we do what we do?\n- Why do we do it the way that we do it?\n\nReengineering begins with no assumptions and no givens - fact, companies that undertake reengineering must guard against the assumptions that most processes already have embedded in them.\n\n**Reengineering first determines what a company must do, then how to do it. Reengineering takes nothing for granted. It ignores what is and concentrates on what should be.**\n\n# Radical\n\nRadical redesign means getting to the root of things: not making superficial changes or fiddling with what is already in place, but throwing away the old and disregarding all existing structures and procedures and inventing completely new ways of accomplishing the work.\n\n# Dramatic\n\nReengineering isn't about making marginal improvements, but about making quantum leaps in performance\n\n# Process\n\nA business process is a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer.\n\nUnder the influence of Adam Smith’s notion of breaking work into its simplest tasks and assigning each of these to a specialist, modern companies and their managers focus on the individual tasks in this process and tend to lose sight of the larger objective, which is to get the goods into the hands of the customer who ordered them. The individual tasks within this process are important, but none of them matter if the overall process doesn't work.\n\n# Who undertakes reengineering?\n\n1. companies that find themselves in deep trouble.\n2. companies that are not yet in trouble but whose management has the foresight to see trouble coming.\n3. companies that are at their peak condition, who are ambitious and aggressive. A truly great company is never satisfied with its performance.\n\n# Recurring Themes in Reengineering\n\n- Several jobs are combined into one\n  - From functional departments to process teams\n  - from simple tasks to multi dimensional work\n- Workers make decisions\n  - From controlled to empowered\n  - from activity to results\n  - advancement criteria changes - from performance to ability\n    - a bonus is appropriate for a job well done; advancement is not\n    - advancement is a function of ability - it is a change NOT A REWARD\n- The steps in the process are performed in natural order\n- Processes can have multiple versions depending on the requirements, environments, situations, inputs\n- The work is performed where it makes the most sense\n- Checks and controls are reduced\n\nIn a company that has reengineered, employees must hold beliefs such as the following:\n\n- Customers pay all our salaries. I must do what it takes to please them.\n- Every job in this company is essential and important. I do make a difference.\n- Showing up is no accomplishment. I get paid for the value I create.\n- The buck stops here. I must accept ownership of problems and get them solved.\n- I belong to a team. We fail or we succeed together.\n- Nobody knows what tomorrow holds. Constant learning is part of my job.\n- Managers change from supervisors to coaches\n\nProcess teams, consisting of one person or many, don’t need bosses; they need coaches. Teams ask coaches for advice. Coaches help teams solve problems. Coaches are not in the action, but they are close enough to it to assist the team in its work. Traditional bosses design and allocate work. Teams do that for themselves. Traditional bosses supervise, monitor, control, and check work as it moves from one task performer to the next. Teams do that themselves. Traditional bosses have little to do in a reengineered environment. Managers have to switch from supervisory roles to acting as facilitators, as enablers, and as people whose jobs are the development of people and their skills so that those people will be able to perform value-adding processes themselves.\n\nManagers in a reengineered company need strong interpersonal skills and have to take pride in the accomplishment of others. Such a manager is a mentor, who is there to provide resources, to answer questions, and to look out for the long-term career development of the individual.

Bardin’s investors pressured him to use that money to hire new employees, add features, and expand to new markets. But Waze was losing new U.S. customers at a rapid rate, and Bardin wasn’t sure why. He ignored the investors’ advice, froze hiring, and asked all employees to stop what they were doing and help figure out what was driving users away in the crucial U.S. market. After six weeks of talking to customers and analyzing data, Waze employees identified customer pain points and began to remove them. Then the company hit the accelerator and started hiring people and releasing a new version of Waze about once a month for six months. Customers loved the changes, and millions became loyal Waze users.

Dozens of other chores arrived courtesy of lawyers, IT administrators, human resources, and nurses and doctors, too. Some were necessary. But many additions (and original requirements) were too complicated or pointless. Many Hawaii Pacific employees complained about the time they were wasting. Yet it was a classic orphan problem, and no one stepped up to reduce these ballooning burdens.\n\nWhere does CipherHealth's solutions fit here, in terms of friction? Are the products necessary?

Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a management approach that focuses on identifying the most important limiting factor (the \"constraint\") in a process and working to improve or eliminate it. The idea is that every system has at least one bottleneck that limits its performance, and by addressing that constraint, the whole system can perform better.\n\nHere’s a simple explanation of how it works:\n\n1. Identify the constraint: Find the part of the process that’s slowing everything down.\n\n\n2. Exploit the constraint: Make sure the constraint is being used as efficiently as possible.\n\n\n3. Subordinate everything to the constraint: Adjust other processes to support the constraint’s performance.\n\n\n4. Elevate the constraint: Take action to eliminate or increase the capacity of the constraint.\n\n\n5. Repeat the process: Once the constraint is resolved, find the next bottleneck and continue improving.\n\n\n\nIn essence, TOC teaches that focusing on the weakest link in a process is the key to improving overall productivity.\n\n","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"5a6a3d61ae85989d6cd061cf","name":"The Goal","idShort":24,"shortLink":"nd1BGK8Q"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d7d333eeb9cebeee4e3","name":"2018 Books/Articles Completed (12 books)"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-09-29T16:46:38.985Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"66f9843a5284dbd3415922b4","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt is a business novel that introduces the Theory of Constraints (TOC). The main point of the book is that the primary goal of a business is to make money, and to achieve this, it’s crucial to identify and manage constraints that hinder the flow of production. The book illustrates that by improving the bottleneck or constraint in a process, the overall system's productivity and profitability can be significantly enhanced. The focus is on continuous improvement, prioritizing throughput, reducing inventory, and minimizing operational expenses. Through the protagonist's journey, it emphasizes systems thinking and aligning resources to optimize the entire system rather than individual components.\n\n","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"5a6a3d61ae85989d6cd061cf","name":"The Goal","idShort":24,"shortLink":"nd1BGK8Q"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d7d333eeb9cebeee4e3","name":"2018 Books/Articles Completed (12 books)"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-09-29T16:45:46.216Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"66f46f227d184620661d1367","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"66f46afb90ad8b4ed8652954","name":"Rapid Knowledge Acquisition and Synthesis","idShort":219,"shortLink":"0YH88BAP"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"6597f599657c72bddda4f6ea","name":"2024 Books Completed "}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-09-25T20:14:26.130Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"66f46b51bafca1b06b8d23fc","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Double-loop learning is a concept introduced by Chris Argyris in the context of organizational learning. It contrasts with single-loop learning and focuses on more profound problem-solving and adaptation.\n\nSingle-Loop Learning:\n\nIn single-loop learning, individuals or organizations detect and correct errors by making adjustments based on established norms, rules, or strategies. It’s like a thermostat adjusting temperature: if the room gets too hot or cold, the thermostat makes minor adjustments to bring it back to the set point, without changing the underlying settings or assumptions.\n\nDouble-Loop Learning:\n\nDouble-loop learning, on the other hand, goes beyond merely adjusting actions. It involves questioning the underlying assumptions, values, or policies that led to the errors in the first place. In essence, it’s a deeper level of reflection where one asks: \"Are we doing the right thing, or should we change the way we think about this altogether?\"\n\nSingle-Loop Example: A company notices a drop in sales and decides to increase marketing efforts to fix it.\n\nDouble-Loop Example: The company not only increases marketing efforts but also asks whether their product aligns with customer needs or whether their pricing strategy is appropriate.\n\n\nBy challenging and changing the fundamental assumptions or mindsets, double-loop learning fosters more adaptive and transformative thinking.\n\nFor someone with your background in systems thinking, double-loop learning could be seen as a way of recognizing feedback loops and not just adjusting the outputs (actions) but also rethinking the structure and inputs that govern those feedback loops.\n\n","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"66f46afb90ad8b4ed8652954","name":"Rapid Knowledge Acquisition and Synthesis","idShort":219,"shortLink":"0YH88BAP"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"6597f599657c72bddda4f6ea","name":"2024 Books Completed "},"dateLastEdited":"2024-09-25T19:59:13.269Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-09-25T19:58:09.806Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"66f46afb90ad8b4ed865296d","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"card":{"id":"66f46afb90ad8b4ed8652954","name":"Rapid Knowledge Acquisition and Synthesis","idShort":219,"shortLink":"0YH88BAP"},"list":{"id":"6597f599657c72bddda4f6ea","name":"2024 Books Completed "},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"createCard","date":"2024-09-25T19:56:43.424Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"660b6724ab74ca70bd40c869","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"In the years separating Columbus’ first journey to America (1492) from the landing of Cortés in Mexico (1519), the Spaniards conquered most of the Caribbean islands, setting up a chain of new colonies.

According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama was heir to a small Himalayan kingdom, sometime around 500 bc. The young prince was deeply affected by the suffering evident all around him. He saw that men and women, children and old people, all suffer not just from occasional calamities such as war and plague, but also from anxiety, frustration and discontent, all of which seem to be an inseparable part of the human condition. People pursue wealth and power, acquire knowledge and possessions, beget sons and daughters, and build houses and palaces. Yet no matter what they achieve, they are never content. Those who live in poverty dream of riches. Those who have a million want two million. Those who have two million want 10 million. Even the rich and famous are rarely satisfied. They too are haunted by ceaseless cares and worries, until sickness, old age and death put a bitter end to them. Everything that one has accumulated vanishes like smoke. Life is a pointless rat race. But how to escape it?\n\nIn the end he came to the realisation that suffering is not caused by ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suffering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one’s own mind.\n\nGautama’s insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction. When the mind experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of the irritation. When the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always dissatisfied and restless. This is very clear when we experience unpleasant things, such as pain. As long as the pain continues, we are dissatisfied and do all we can to avoid it. Yet even when we experience pleasant things we are never content. We either fear that the pleasure might disappear, or we hope that it will intensify.\n\nGautama found that there was a way to exit this vicious circle. If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind. But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? Gautama developed a set of meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is, without craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question, ‘What am I experiencing now?’ rather than on ‘What would I rather be experiencing?’ It is difficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"65f83d8f002063834ed4bb11","name":"Sapiens","idShort":218,"shortLink":"tTyuq1ds"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2024-03-31T22:14:01.740Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-03-31T22:12:11.298Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"65f8e90ae045be3a1819f6c7","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"65f83d8f002063834ed4bb11","name":"Sapiens","idShort":218,"shortLink":"tTyuq1ds"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-03-19T01:23:22.993Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"65f8e8c9c7f418685576f1b6","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities.

If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of ancient farmers.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"65f83d8f002063834ed4bb11","name":"Sapiens","idShort":218,"shortLink":"tTyuq1ds"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-03-19T00:06:20.382Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"65f8d4651028e6998259c66e","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality.

His approach, often summarized as \"Taylorism,\" is built on four core principles:\n\n1. **Scientifically Study Each Part of the Task**: Instead of using rule-of-thumb methods, Taylor advocated for a scientific approach to study work methods. This involved analyzing tasks with the goal of determining the most efficient way to perform them.\n\n2. **Scientifically Select, Train, and Develop Each Worker**: Rather than letting workers train themselves, Taylor suggested that workers should be selected based on their abilities and trained by the organization to perform the task at hand. This included teaching them the best methods discovered through scientific study.\n\n3. **Cooperate with the Workers to Ensure that the Scientifically Developed Methods are Being Followed**: Taylor emphasized the importance of management working closely with workers to ensure that the work is done according to the scientifically determined methods. This cooperation was meant to ensure that work was performed efficiently and in a way that maximizes productivity.\n\n4. **Divide Work Nearly Equally Between Managers and Workers**: Taylor proposed that management should take over all the work for which they are better suited than the workers. This includes planning the work and any preparatory steps that involve handling the tools and materials. Workers, on the other hand, should be responsible for executing the work according to the plans developed by management. This division was meant to leverage the strengths of each group, ensuring that both managers and workers focus on what they do best.\n\nThese principles were revolutionary at the time and laid the foundation for modern management practices. However, they have also been criticized for dehumanizing workers and reducing their jobs to a series of mechanical tasks. Despite the criticism, Taylor's principles of scientific management have had a lasting impact on the way work is organized and managed in various sectors.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"65c125285ce49b002a558ea7","name":"Principles of Scientific

These reserves must be sufficient to cover the entire monetary base of the domestic currency.\n\n3. **Issue and Redeem Currency**: The board stands ready to exchange domestic currency for the foreign anchor currency at any time and at the fixed rate. This means that the domestic currency is fully convertible.\n\n4. **No Monetary Policy**: Unlike a central bank, a currency board cannot independently set monetary policy. Its sole function is to maintain the exchange rate. Interest rates and money supply are determined by the movement of currency in and out of the system as people exchange domestic currency for the anchor currency.\n\n### Advantages:\n\n- **Stability**: By pegging to a stable foreign currency, the domestic currency can inherit that stability, leading to lower inflation and more predictable economic conditions.\n\n- **Confidence**: A currency board can help build confidence in the domestic currency, especially if the country has a history of monetary instability or inflation.\n\n- **Simplicity and Transparency**: The rules and operations of a currency board are straightforward and transparent, making it easier for businesses and investors to make decisions.\n\n### Disadvantages:\n\n- **Loss of Monetary Policy**: The country loses the ability to conduct its monetary policy, meaning it can't adjust interest rates or use other monetary tools to respond to economic changes.\n\n- **Dependence on Foreign Economy**: The domestic economy becomes closely tied to the conditions in the foreign country whose currency is used as the anchor. If that country experiences inflation or other economic problems, the effects can spill over.\n\n- **Requirement for Reserves**: The currency board needs to maintain substantial foreign reserves, which can be costly and require significant discipline.\n\n### Examples:\n\nCurrency boards have been used successfully in various countries. Hong Kong, for instance, has maintained a currency board system since 1983, pegging the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar. Other countries have used them during periods of transition or instability to stabilize their currencies and build confidence.\n\nIn summary, a currency board is a strict monetary regime that can provide stability and confidence in a country's currency but at the cost of surrendering control over domestic monetary policy. It's most suitable for small, open economies with a significant reliance on trade with the anchor currency's country.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-01-02T13:16:27.096Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"659408bdc05b2355478fd3c1","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"To deal with inflation, shrink the monetary base.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2024-01-02T12:59:41.037Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658dbe1a95a31d61058520e4","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/federal-funds-rate/#:~:text=How%20Does%20the%20Federal%20Funds,currently%205.25%25%20to%205.50%25.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T18:27:38.889Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658db51bb25331dadb563d15","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Lowering the federal funds rate doesn't directly devalue money in the sense of reducing its nominal value, but it can affect the value of money in several indirect ways:\n\n1. **Inflation**: Lowering the federal funds rate makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Increased demand can lead to higher prices if supply doesn't keep up, potentially causing inflation. Over time, inflation reduces the purchasing power of money — what you can buy for a dollar today might be more than what you can buy tomorrow.\n\n2. **Interest Rates**: When the federal funds rate is lowered, other interest rates typically follow, including those for savings accounts, CDs, and other deposit vehicles. This means that savers earn less interest on their deposits, reducing the incentive to save and potentially decreasing the value of stored money over time, especially in the face of inflation.\n\n3. **Investment and Consumption**: Lower rates encourage borrowing and can lead to more investment and consumption. While this can be good for economic growth, it also increases the money supply in circulation, which, if not matched by corresponding growth in goods and services, can reduce the value of money.\n\n4. **Exchange Rates**: Lowering interest rates can make a currency less attractive to foreign investors, as they seek higher returns elsewhere. This can lead to a depreciation of the currency in the foreign exchange markets, meaning it takes more of that currency to buy foreign goods, services, or assets.\n\n5. **Expectations**: Monetary policy can shape expectations. If people expect that lower rates will lead to inflation, they might spend more quickly, further increasing demand and potentially fueling inflation.\n\nHowever, these effects aren't automatic or immediate and can vary based on the broader economic context. For instance, if the economy is in a recession or facing deflationary pressures, lowering the federal funds rate might help to stimulate demand and prevent deflation without necessarily causing significant inflation or devaluing money.\n\nIt's also worth noting that central banks consider these potential effects when making decisions. Their goal is typically to balance stimulating economic growth while maintaining price stability, ensuring that any potential devaluing of money is controlled and not harmful to the economy.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T17:49:15.748Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658db5053f3a637f4e8b95cb","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"When the federal funds rate is cut, it typically signals a more accommodative monetary policy aimed at stimulating economic growth. Here's what investors might consider in such an environment:\n\n1. **Bonds and Fixed Income**: Lower rates often mean existing bonds with higher rates become more valuable, so fixed-income securities might see price increases. However, new bonds will be issued at these lower rates, offering less attractive yields.\n\n2. **Stocks**: Generally, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper for companies, which can boost profits and investment. This can make stocks more appealing, particularly those in growth sectors or industries sensitive to interest rates like real estate, construction, and consumer discretionary goods.\n\n3. **Real Estate**: Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing money for mortgages, potentially stimulating the real estate market. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other property-related investments might benefit.\n\n4. **Dividend Stocks**: With bonds and savings accounts offering lower yields, investors might turn to stocks with high dividend yields for income.\n\n5. **Gold and Commodities**: Lower rates can weaken the currency and lead to inflationary pressures, which might make assets like gold, traditionally seen as a store of value, more attractive.\n\n6. **Emerging Markets**: Lower rates in developed countries can lead investors to seek higher returns in emerging markets, which might offer higher growth potential and yields.\n\n7. **Sector-Specific Opportunities**: Some sectors benefit more directly from lower interest rates. For example, financials might suffer from lower margins, while consumer discretionary and technology might gain from increased consumer spending and investment.\n\n**Considerations for Investors**:\n\n- **Risk Tolerance**: Lower rates often encourage risk-taking, but investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before making decisions.\n- **Inflation**: If lower rates lead to inflation, it's important to consider investments that can potentially offer protection or keep pace with rising prices.\n- **Diversification**: Diversifying across asset classes can help manage risk in a changing economic environment.\n- **Economic Outlook**: Consider the broader economic context. Lower rates are typically a response to slower growth or economic challenges. The effectiveness of rate cuts and the economic outlook can significantly impact investment performance.\n\nInvestors should also stay informed about economic trends and be prepared to adjust their strategies as conditions change. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to individual financial goals and circumstances.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T17:48:53.439Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658db2fd42ba288450ec8dda","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions (banks and credit unions) lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis. It's a critically important rate in the U.S. economy as it influences all other interest rates, including those for savings accounts, mortgages, and loans. Here's what you need to know about it:\n\n1. **Set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)**: The rate isn't set by law but rather is targeted by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. The FOMC meets eight times a year to set the target rate based on the current economic conditions.\n\n2. **Influencing the Economy**: By raising or lowering the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve aims to influence economic activity. Lowering the rate makes borrowing cheaper and can stimulate spending and investment, while raising the rate can help cool down an overheating economy and control inflation.\n\n3. **Implementation**: The Federal Reserve doesn't set the federal funds rate directly. Instead, it influences the rate through open market operations, adjusting the supply of money that banks can lend. The Fed buys or sells government securities to alter the reserve balances of banks, which in turn affects the rates at which banks lend to each other.\n\n4. **Indicator of Monetary Policy**: The federal funds rate is a key indicator of the stance of U.S. monetary policy. A low rate indicates a more accommodative policy (aimed at stimulating economic growth), while a high rate indicates a restrictive policy (aimed at controlling inflation).\n\n5. **Impact on Other Rates**: Changes in the federal funds rate can affect a wide range of other interest rates. For example, the prime rate (the rate banks charge their best customers) is typically set 3 percentage points above the federal funds rate. It also influences savings account rates, mortgage rates, and the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers.\n\n6. **Economic Indicators**: The FOMC sets the target for the federal funds rate based on its assessment of the economic outlook. It considers factors like inflation, employment, international developments, and expectations for future growth.\n\nThe federal funds rate is a fundamental tool for managing the U.S. economy, and changes to the rate can have widespread effects on economic activity, making it a closely watched indicator worldwide.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T17:40:13.397Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658db28de44e59153c75e112","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Remember: when money is devalued, the first place it goes is into hard assets","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2023-12-28T17:38:45.372Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T17:38:21.847Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658db13a1d452c0058ed7a69","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The Nixon Shock refers to a series of economic measures undertaken by U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971, which led to the end of the Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange. The most significant and remembered of these measures was the unilateral cancellation of the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to gold. Here's what happened and its implications:\n\n1. **Background**: Post World War II, the Bretton Woods system was established, creating a framework for international financial exchange. Countries agreed to fix their currencies to the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. dollar was fixed to gold at $35 an ounce. This system created stability, but by the 1960s, it was under strain due to a variety of factors, including U.S. balance of payments deficits and the expense of the Vietnam War.\n\n2. **The Nixon Shock**: On August 15, 1971, President Nixon announced several economic policies:\n   - **Suspension of Dollar Convertibility to Gold**: Effectively ending the Bretton Woods system, Nixon announced that the U.S. would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value, essentially moving the world to a fiat currency system.\n   - **Wage and Price Controls**: To combat inflation, Nixon imposed 90-day freezes on wages and prices.\n   - **Import Surcharge**: A 10% surcharge was placed on all imports to protect American industry and address the trade deficit.\n\n3. **Consequences**:\n   - **End of Bretton Woods**: The move effectively ended the Bretton Woods system and led to a series of negotiations and adjustments, resulting in floating exchange rates and the transformation of the international financial system.\n   - **Currency Fluctuations**: With the end of fixed exchange rates, currencies began to float against each other, leading to increased volatility and new opportunities and risks in international trade and finance.\n   - **Inflation**: The initial impact led to inflation in the U.S., as the dollar's value declined without the gold backing, and other countries began to revalue their currencies.\n   - **Transition to Fiat Money**: The world gradually moved to a system of fiat currencies, where the value is not based on physical commodities but rather on the economic performance and policies of the governments that issue them.\n\nThe Nixon Shock was a pivotal moment in the 20th century, profoundly reshaping international finance, trade, and monetary policy. Its effects are still felt today in the way countries manage exchange rates, control capital flows, and engage in international trade.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T17:32:42.821Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658daf5dcbb2433d60a2e9ec","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Inflation inequality refers to the disproportionate impact of inflation on different groups within society, often exacerbating pre-existing economic disparities. It's based on the observation that the effects of inflation are not uniformly felt; instead, they vary significantly depending on one's income level, wealth, spending patterns, and access to financial tools. Here's how it generally manifests and its implications:\n\n1. **Differential Impact on Spending**: Lower-income households typically spend a higher proportion of their income on necessities like food, housing, and energy, which often see faster price increases during inflationary periods. As a result, inflation can take a larger bite out of their income compared to wealthier households that spend a smaller proportion of their income on these essentials.\n\n2. **Savings and Investment**: Higher-income individuals usually have more substantial savings and are more likely to invest in assets like stocks, real estate, or other investments that can provide protection against inflation. In contrast, lower-income households often hold their limited savings in cash or in forms more vulnerable to inflation, eroding their purchasing power over time.\n\n3. **Access to Credit**: Wealthier individuals typically have better access to credit and can borrow at lower interest rates, allowing them to manage or even leverage inflationary periods more effectively. In contrast, those with lower incomes might face higher borrowing costs, making it harder to cope with rising prices.\n\n4. **Wage Dynamics**: Some professions and industries might see wages keeping up with or outpacing inflation, while others do not. Lower-income workers often have less bargaining power and are less likely to see their wages adjusted for inflation promptly, leading to a real decrease in income.\n\n5. **Fixed Incomes**: People on fixed incomes, such as retirees living on pensions that don't fully adjust for inflation, can find their purchasing power significantly eroded during inflationary periods.\n\n6. **Geographical Variations**: Inflation can vary significantly by region, affecting urban and rural households differently. This can be due to differences in the cost of living, availability of goods and services, and economic conditions.\n\n7. **Policy Responses**: The ways in which governments and central banks respond to inflation can also have varying impacts. For example, if a central bank raises interest rates to combat inflation, it might cool the economy and increase unemployment, which can disproportionately affect lower-income workers.\n\nInflation inequality is a critical consideration for policymakers because it can exacerbate poverty, reduce the real income of the most vulnerable, and widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Understanding and addressing the differential impacts of inflation is crucial for creating effective economic policies and maintaining social stability.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T17:24:45.814Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658daef2112bbb125e64c623","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The term \"inflation stealth tax\" refers to the idea that inflation acts as a kind of hidden tax on individuals' wealth and purchasing power. While it's not an official tax from the government, it has a similar effect by reducing the value of money over time. Here's how it works and its implications:\n\n1. **Reducing Purchasing Power**: Inflation means that the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. As a result, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. This reduction in purchasing power hits consumers, as their money doesn't go as far as it used to.\n\n2. **Eroding Savings**: For people who have cash savings, inflation gradually reduces the value of those savings. If the interest rate on their savings is lower than the rate of inflation, their savings lose value in real terms, effectively eroding their wealth.\n\n3. **Debt Dynamics**: Inflation can benefit those with existing debts, as the real value of their debt decreases over time. Essentially, they repay their debts with money that's worth less than when they borrowed it. However, this can be a double-edged sword, as lenders might increase interest rates to compensate for higher expected inflation.\n\n4. **Government Debt**: Inflation can also reduce the real value of government debt. When a government owes money, high inflation means that it repays its debts with money that's worth less than when it borrowed. This is one reason some claim that inflation acts like a tax: it's a way for the government to reduce the real value of its own debts, much like collecting more taxes to pay down debt.\n\n5. **Regressive Impact**: Inflation can be considered regressive, meaning it tends to hit those with lower incomes harder. These individuals often hold a larger proportion of their wealth in cash and have less access to inflation-hedging investments like real estate or stocks.\n\n6. **No Actual Revenue**: Unlike a traditional tax, inflation doesn't provide actual revenue to the government. Instead, it reduces the real burden of government debts and can indirectly benefit government finances if it leads to higher nominal income tax receipts.\n\n7. **Public Awareness**: One reason inflation is referred to as a \"stealth\" tax is that it's often less visible and less well-understood by the general public than direct taxes like income tax. People might notice the effects of inflation, but they don't receive a bill for it, and they might not immediately attribute changes in their purchasing power to government policy.\n\nWhile inflation can act similarly to a tax in its effects on purchasing power and wealth, it's important to note that it's influenced by a wide range of factors, not just government policy. These include global economic conditions, supply and demand dynamics, and changes in energy prices, among others. As such, managing inflation is a complex aspect of economic policy with significant implications for everyone in the economy.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T17:22:58.513Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658d004fdb8236ab447b9d49","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is a macroeconomic framework that rethinks the way we understand money, government spending, and fiscal policy. It challenges conventional beliefs about the way governments finance spending and the role of fiscal policy. Here's a breakdown of its key principles:\n\n1. **Government as a Currency Issuer**: MMT posits that a government that issues its own fiat currency cannot run out of money in the same way a household or business can. It doesn't need to collect taxes or borrow before it can spend; it can create more money as needed.\n\n2. **Role of Taxes**: According to MMT, the primary purpose of taxes is not to finance government operations but to control inflation by reducing the money supply and to achieve other social objectives. Taxes can also help redistribute income and regulate aggregate demand.\n\n3. **Debt and Deficits**: MMT suggests that government deficits are not inherently problematic. In fact, they are necessary and normal for economic growth, especially underutilized economies. When the government spends more than it taxes, this adds money to the economy, which can then be used by the private sector to save, invest, and consume.\n\n4. **Inflation Concerns**: While MMT acknowledges that excessive money creation can lead to inflation, it argues that a government can manage inflation by controlling demand through fiscal policy (taxing and spending) rather than relying on monetary policy (changing interest rates).\n\n5. **Unemployment**: MMT advocates for a Job Guarantee program, proposing that the government should act as an \"employer of last resort,\" offering a job to anyone who is willing and able to work but cannot find employment in the private sector. This would maintain full employment and stabilize the economy.\n\n6. **Policy Implications**: MMT suggests that a government with its own currency can and should run larger deficits to finance public investments, improve infrastructure, ensure full employment, and address other societal needs, without worrying about the deficit in the same way a household or business would.\n\n**Criticisms and Controversies**:\n- **Inflation Risk**: Critics argue that MMT underestimates the risk of inflation and currency devaluation, especially if the government excessively prints money.\n- **Policy Feasibility**: There are concerns about how practical and effective it would be to use taxes and government spending to manage inflation and economic demand.\n- **Political Risks**: Giving politicians the perceived power to spend freely may lead to fiscal irresponsibility and short-sighted policies.\n\nMMT is a subject of intense debate among economists, policymakers, and scholars. While it offers a new perspective on fiscal policy and government spending, its practical implications and effectiveness are topics of ongoing debate and research.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T04:57:51.554Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658cff2b39e83d2aac814a37","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"A reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) is a financial transaction in which one party sells a security to another party with the agreement to buy it back at a later date for a higher price. It's essentially the opposite of a \"repo\" or repurchase agreement. Here's how it works and why it's used:\n\n### How it Works:\n1. **Transaction Initiation**: One party (often a financial institution like a commercial bank) sells securities to another party (like a central bank) and agrees to repurchase them at a specific date and for a predetermined price.\n  \n2. **Temporary Transfer**: The buyer (e.g., the central bank) now temporarily holds the securities and provides cash to the seller. The difference between the sale and repurchase price reflects the interest.\n\n3. **Repurchase**: On the agreed-upon future date, the original seller buys back the securities at the higher price, which includes the original selling price plus the interest.\n\n### Purposes and Implications:\n- **Liquidity Management**: Financial institutions use reverse repos to manage short-term liquidity. By selling securities with a promise to buy them back, they get the cash they need for short-term operations.\n\n- **Monetary Policy**: Central banks use reverse repos as a tool to control the money supply. By conducting reverse repos, they remove cash from the banking system, thereby reducing the money supply and potentially raising short-term interest rates.\n\n- **Safe Investment**: For buyers like central banks, reverse repos are a short-term investment vehicle. They get to hold securities (often government bonds) for the duration of the reverse repo, earning a small return.\n\n- **Risk Reduction**: Reverse repos are seen as a low-risk way for financial institutions to obtain short-term financing. The securities involved provide collateral, reducing the risk for the buyer.\n\n### Central Bank Perspective:\nWhen a central bank enters into reverse repos, it's often aiming to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system, which can help in controlling inflation and stabilizing currency. It's a common tool used to help manage the bank's monetary policy and influence interest rates.\n\n### Market Impact:\nThe use of reverse repos can significantly influence the short-term interest rates and liquidity conditions in the financial markets. By removing cash from the system, reverse repos can help tighten the money supply and potentially raise short-term interest rates, acting as a tool for central banks to implement their desired monetary policy.\n\nIn summary, reverse repos are a critical financial tool for liquidity management and monetary policy. They offer a secured way for institutions to obtain short-term financing while allowing central banks to influence the money supply and interest rates.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T04:52:59.207Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658cfd6935cb651723d11ec0","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Quantitative Easing (QE) is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate the economy when traditional monetary policy has become ineffective. Central banks implement QE by purchasing longer-term securities from the open market to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. Here's how it typically works and its implications:\n\n1. **Purchasing Assets**: In a QE program, a central bank buys financial assets, typically government bonds and sometimes other types of assets like corporate bonds or mortgage-backed securities, from financial institutions.\n\n2. **Increasing Money Supply**: By purchasing these securities, the central bank adds new money to the system, which increases the excess reserves of the banks. This is intended to lower interest rates and encourage banks to lend more to businesses and consumers.\n\n3. **Lowering Interest Rates**: QE aims to lower the yields on the bonds and other long-term assets it purchases. This, in turn, reduces long-term interest rates across the economy, encouraging borrowing and spending.\n\n4. **Stimulating the Economy**: Lower interest rates make loans cheaper, which can stimulate investment and consumption. The increased demand can help combat deflationary pressures and stimulate economic growth.\n\n5. **Increasing Asset Prices**: By creating demand for securities, QE can also raise the prices of those securities. This has a wealth effect, as the increased value of assets can make businesses and consumers feel wealthier and more likely to spend.\n\n6. **Risks and Criticisms**: QE is not without its critics and risks. It can lead to inflation if too much money is created. It may also distort financial markets, lead to asset bubbles, and benefit the wealthy more than the average citizen by disproportionately raising asset prices. Furthermore, exiting a QE program can be challenging without disrupting financial markets.\n\nQuantitative Easing is generally used when interest rates are already near zero and the central bank cannot lower them further (a situation known as the \"zero lower bound\"). It's a way to inject liquidity directly into the economy to encourage spending and investment when other tools are ineffective.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T04:45:29.518Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658cfc4a64ccf8ad6543eebe","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"What are open market operations\n\nOpen Market Operations (OMOs) are a key monetary policy tool used by central banks to control the money supply and interest rates in the economy. Here's how they typically work:\n\n1. **Buying and Selling Government Securities**: The central bank buys or sells government bonds and other securities. When it buys securities, it pays for them with money it creates, which increases the amount of money in the banking system, lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Conversely, when the central bank sells securities, it takes money out of circulation, raising interest rates and decreasing the money supply.\n\n2. **Targeting the Federal Funds Rate**: In the U.S., for example, the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. By buying securities, the Fed adds reserves to the banking system, making it easier for banks to lend to each other, which lowers the rate. Selling securities has the opposite effect.\n\n3. **Influencing the Economy**: By controlling the federal funds rate, central banks can influence other interest rates, including those for mortgages, loans, and savings. Lower interest rates generally encourage borrowing and spending, which can stimulate economic growth. Higher rates can help cool an overheating economy and control inflation.\n\n4. **Implementation**: OMOs are typically conducted via auctions where the central bank announces the amount of securities it wants to buy or sell. Financial institutions then submit bids indicating how much they are willing to buy or sell and at what price.\n\n5. **Reversibility**: OMOs are easily reversed. If the central bank wants to reverse the effect of a previous OMO, it can simply sell securities if it had previously bought them, or buy them back if it had sold them.\n\nOpen Market Operations are a flexible and commonly used tool to implement monetary policy, allowing central banks to respond quickly to changes in the economic climate.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2023-12-28T04:42:24.742Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T04:40:42.849Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658cfb7d4b247c7af810520e","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Fiat currency is a type of currency that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver but is instead backed by the government that issued it.

This often leads to a loss of confidence in the currency, causing people to spend it quickly or convert it into more stable foreign currencies.\n\nHyperinflation is usually caused by a combination of excessive supply of money (often when a government prints money to pay for its spending) and a lack of confidence in the economy or the stability of the currency.

Central banks often adjust the money supply in response to changes in employment and wages to stabilize the economy. Here's a general outline of how this might work:\n\n1. **Employment Rises**: As employment increases, more people have incomes, leading to higher demand for goods and services. This can lead to inflation if the demand outstrips supply. In response, a central bank might decrease the money supply to control inflation by raising interest rates or selling government securities. This action can cool down spending and investment.\n\n2. **Employment Falls**: In a situation where employment decreases, spending and demand might drop, leading to lower inflation or even deflation. To combat this, a central bank might increase the money supply to encourage spending and investment by lowering interest rates or buying government securities.\n\n3. **Rising Salaries**: When wages rise, workers have more money to spend, which can increase demand and potentially lead to inflation. If the central bank perceives this as a risk to price stability, it might tighten the money supply.\n\n4. **Falling Salaries**: Conversely, if wages fall or stagnate, consumer spending might decrease, leading to lower demand and slowing the economy. The central bank might then increase the money supply to boost spending and investment.\n\nCentral banks aim to maintain a balance where the economy grows steadily without high inflation. They use various indicators, including employment and wage data, to decide how to adjust the money supply. The timing and effectiveness of these adjustments can vary, and central banks often operate with a lag, meaning they're responding to data about what has already happened in the economy, not what is happening right now.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T00:16:40.920Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658cbe5764fdf749e135df72","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The monetary supply changes through various mechanisms primarily controlled by a country's central bank.

Lowering the reserve requirement increases the money supply by allowing banks to lend more of their deposits, while raising it does the opposite.\n\n3. **Discount Rate**: This is the interest rate charged to commercial banks for short-term loans from the central bank.

Raising it has the opposite effect.\n\n4. **Interest on Excess Reserves**: Central banks may pay interest on the excess reserves banks hold at the central bank. Lowering this rate encourages banks to lend out more of their reserves, increasing the money supply, while raising it encourages banks to hold more reserves, decreasing the money supply.\n\n5. **Direct Lending to Financial Institutions**: In some cases, central banks might provide loans to financial institutions to ensure liquidity and stability, thus increasing the money supply.\n\n6. **Quantitative Easing (QE)**: In more extreme situations, central banks might engage in QE, where they buy long-term securities in the open market to inject liquidity directly into the economy.\n\nThese tools can be used to influence inflation, employment, and overall economic growth. The specific strategies and tools vary by country and economic context.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6580523a20da1547e361a045","name":"Inflation: What it is, Why it's bad, and How to fix it","idShort":215,"shortLink":"8ccMbkb5"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-28T00:16:23.362Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658cbd6cda4acc901ec8e36c","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The base money supply, also known as the monetary base, is the total amount of a currency that is either in general circulation in the hands of the public or in the commercial bank deposits held in the central bank's reserves.

an event, which implies: It has intrinsic symbolism to different parties; It knows a timeframe and deadlines; It has crowds, however small, and generally VIPs present; It’s not just the event itself, but extends to people coming and going to and from the event (if something goes wrong); and It attracts media attention. \n\nMajor event organization means multiple stakeholders, e.g.: Organizers \nAuthorities \nInsurers \nParticipants/Talent \nPublic Media \nVendors \nSponsors \nTransport \n\nIt is major (size/importance/profile), which implies:\n\nIt is of some size and may well be multi-venue; \nThe site may well have a unique infrastructure unfamiliar to many; \nThe event may well be of some duration (month-long World Cup); \nMost events will know multiple public-private partnership parties and dimensions, starting with safety and security; \nThere are likely to be considerable funds at stake in terms of revenue, investment, and insurance. \n\nMajor events are increasingly international, if not by design then at least in attendance. For organizers, this implies: \nDuty of Care responsibilities as an organizer and host; \nThe national brand is at stake; \nOne will have to account for and appropriately deal with multiple languages and cultures; \nand There is a significant travel/transport/hotel aspect. \n\n\nAs important as those four fixed dimensions is a fifth, and that, for lack of a better term, is the “big variables” around major events that often impede both emergency and crisis planning. The big variables around major events are: Planning requirements will change over time and require the customi zed application of Good Practice. British top crowd dynamics expert Professor Keith Still put it to me thus in 2020: “Many people don’t realize the review requirement of risk and customized measures applies for each event. Too many, especially venue shows and annual repeats, are handled by rote and in a compliance check-off fashion”; Each event venue, city and country has its constraints (be it the size of the budget or the number of law enforcement); Threats to major events differ and evolve, and there will be multiple ones (not just drunk fans, terrorists, mediocre safety inspectors, absent volunteers or poor WiFi infrastructure); Depending on what happens, multiple command centers are likely to overlap on response duties.

These factors can include:\n\n1. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Interruptions in the supply chain can lead to scarcity of goods, driving up prices. This can be due to natural disasters, geopolitical events, or other logistical challenges.\n\n2. **Increased Production Costs**: When the cost of raw materials, labor, or other production inputs rises, companies may pass these costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\n3. **Demand-Pull Factors**: This occurs when demand for certain goods or services increases significantly, outstripping supply, and leading to higher prices.\n\n4. **Regulatory Changes**: New regulations or taxes can increase the cost of production or distribution, leading to higher prices for consumers.\n\n5. **Market Power**: Companies with significant market power or monopolistic tendencies might raise prices independently of monetary factors.\n\nNon-monetary inflation can occur even in situations where monetary policy is stable and the money supply isn't expanding rapidly.

So focus on the concept of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM - next section) and CM process to master any risk and examine varied risks, and every so often, practice on risks completely off the Business Continuity Top 10 list.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"657f7035a8605763375f7341","name":"Code Black: 50 Lessons in Crisis Management for Effective Leadership","idShort":214,"shortLink":"zQ2vRuoJ"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2023-12-18T12:12:02.132Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-18T12:10:58.109Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"658033891c15d902c03a90ba","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Risk awareness is a cornerstone for preventing crises and getting a handle on one if it cannot be prevented.

The key part to focus on is the analogy of \"finding the edge pieces of your situation.\" This is a metaphor derived from the strategy often used in solving jigsaw puzzles, where one starts by assembling the edge pieces first. Here's a breakdown of the sentence:\n\n1. **Rapid Sense-Making and Scoping**: This refers to quickly understanding the situation at hand and determining its scope. In crisis management, it's crucial to quickly grasp what's happening and how big or serious the situation is.\n\n2. **Yes/No of a Crisis**: This is about determining whether a situation actually constitutes a crisis. Sometimes it's not immediately clear if what you're facing is a crisis or a less serious issue.\n\n3. **Finding the Edge Pieces of Your Situation**: In jigsaw puzzles, edge pieces form the boundary and give a frame to work within. In a crisis situation, this metaphor suggests identifying the most clear, defining aspects of the situation first. These are the facts or elements that are most certain and indisputable. They form the 'frame' of the situation, like the outer edges of a puzzle.\n\n4. **Work Your Way Back to Fill in the Picture**: Once the boundaries (edge pieces) are established, you then start filling in the rest of the details (the middle pieces of the puzzle). This means gradually dealing with less clear aspects of the situation, using the framework you've established to guide your understanding and actions.\n\nIn summary, the sentence is advising that in situations where it's not immediately clear if you're facing a crisis, start by identifying and understanding the most definitive elements of the situation. These elements act as a framework to guide further investigation and action, helping you to understand and manage the situation more effectively.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"657f7035a8605763375f7341","name":"Code Black: 50 Lessons in Crisis Management for Effective

of the notorious obstacles to flow is the need to frequently stop because we are missing something that is essential in order to move forward. ‘Full-kit’ means that before we start a task or a project, we first verify we have everything we need to complete it.\n\nlook at your operation and identify all the junctions in which major tasks start; junctions in which there is a synchronization between re sources or there is a handover of the work to the next resource in line. In each of these junctions there should be a gate. When a task or project arrives at the gate, the gate should be closed. The next resource in line will not be permitted to start working on that task or project before we verify it has a full-kit.”\n\ninitial effort is to identify where in the operation you should have gates. Then you need to appoint someone to be responsible for watching the gates. Each time a task or project arrives at a gate, the gatekeeper will check that it has a full-kit and only then open the gate, allowing work to continue.”","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"657875d399111fb887316265","name":"Goldratt's Rules of Flow","idShort":213,"shortLink":"MDsrboLf"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2023-12-12T18:50:12.662Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-12-12T18:34:20.936Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"6578a6ae1fbd3ebe0c7533e3","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"“One of the biggest obstacles to projects’ flow is bad multitasking.

Architecting products is more efficient than just designing point solutions to projects and focuses the team on its customers.\n\n**Principle 2**: Focus on quality attributes, not on functional requirements. Quality attribute requirements drive the architecture.\n\n**Principle 3**: Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary. Design architectures based on facts, not on guesses. There is no point in designing and implementing capabilities that may never be used—it is a waste of time and resources.\n\n**Principle 4**: Architect for change—leverage the “power of small.” Big, monolithic, tightly coupled components are hard to change. Instead, leverage small, loosely coupled software elements.\n\n**Principle 5**: Architect for build, test, deploy, and operate. Most architecture methodologies focus exclusively on software building activities, but we believe that architects should be concerned about testing, deployment, and operation, too, in order to support continuous delivery.\n\n**Principle 6**: Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on. The way teams are organized drives the architecture and design of the systems they are working on.\n\nWoods, Eoin; Erder, Murat; Pureur, Pierre.

Finishing is the ultimate form of black swan prevention; after a project is done, it can’t blow up, at least not as regards delivery. \n\nThe critical next step is to stop thinking of black swans the way most people do.

You need to get serious about gathering enough data to allow you to statistically analyze the distribution and determine if it’s normal or fat-tailed. If it’s normal or near normal, do a reference-class forecast using the mean. This would still give you an approximately 50 percent risk of a small cost overrun. If you want to reduce this risk further, add a 10 to 15 percent contingency (reserve), and you’re done.[24] If you face a fat-tailed distribution, shift your mindset from forecasting a single outcome (“The project will cost X”) to forecasting risk (“The project is X percent likely to cost more than Y”), using the full range of the distribution. In a typical fat-tailed distribution in project management, about 80 percent of the outcomes will make up the body of the distribution. That’s pretty normal; nothing really scary there. For that portion of the distribution, you can protect yourself the usual way with affordable contingencies that will fit into a budget. But the tail outcomes—the “black swans”—cover about 20 percent of the distribution. That means a 20 percent chance of ending up in the tail, which is too much risk for most organizations.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"646e872703e178789264beb1","name":"How Big Things Get Done","idShort":210,"shortLink":"9tEAhFsw"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2023-06-12T21:06:52.642Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-06-12T21:06:12.299Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"64878833b44e319a762cf0f9","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"**A fat-tailed distribution** is a kind of statistical pattern where the frequency or probability of an event happening is more spread out and unpredictable than usual.

Err on the side of inclusion. And adjust the average only when there are compelling reasons to do so, which means that data exist that support the adjustment. When in doubt, skip adjustment altogether. The class mean is the anchor, and the anchor is your forecast. That’s very simple, yes. But simple is good; it keeps out bias.\n\nThe core of reference-class forecasting is an anchor-and-adjustment process similar to what Robert Caro and MTR did—but using the right anchor. What makes the reference class the right anchor is what I emphasized in the previous chapter: relevant real-world experience. One person did a kitchen renovation using basic fixtures and appliances; with no surprises and a smooth delivery, it cost $20,000 and took two weeks. Another went with granite countertops and lots of stainless steel, then discovered that the house’s wiring wasn’t up to code; the project wound up costing $40,000, and thanks to an electrician who was overbooked, it took two months to finish.

Recognize the potential pitfalls of traditional project planning methods that overlook the final goal.\n2. Emphasize the importance of determining the desired outcome and avoiding getting lost in details and difficulties.\n3. Acknowledge the risk of projects deviating from their intended path if the ultimate goal is not clearly understood and prioritized.\n\nStep 2: PR and FAQ Development\n4\\. Acknowledge Jeff Bezos's innovative approach to maintain Amazon's customer focus.\n5\\. Establish that the conventional last step of project completion, involving the creation of a press release (PR) and a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document by the communications department, becomes the initial step in Amazon projects.\n6\\. Draft a concise PR that highlights the new product or service's value for customers, placing the goal prominently in the opening sentences. Develop an FAQ document with additional details about costs, functionality, and concerns.\n\nStep 3: \"Oprah-speak\" Language\n7\\. Recognize the need for plain language, termed \"Oprah-speak,\" in both the PR and FAQ documents.\n8\\. Explain that \"Oprah-speak\" refers to explaining concepts in a simple way that anyone can understand, similar to how Oprah would communicate with her audience on her show.\n9\\. Emphasize that using plain language prevents flaws from being concealed behind jargon, slogans, or technical terms, and exposes any fuzzy, ill-considered, illogical, or unsupported assumptions.\n\nStep 4: Project Pitch Meeting\n10\\. Schedule a one-hour meeting with top executives to pitch the new project.\n11\\. Prohibit the use of PowerPoint presentations and typical corporate tools.\n12\\. Distribute copies of the PR and FAQ documents to all participants and instruct them to read them silently and attentively.\n\nStep 5: Initial Thoughts and Feedback\n13\\. Encourage meeting participants to share their initial thoughts and impressions about the project after reading the PR/FAQ documents.\n14\\. Facilitate an open discussion where individuals express their opinions, starting with junior staff members and concluding with senior executives to avoid premature influence.\n15\\. Conduct a detailed line-by-line review of the PR/FAQ documents, allowing participants to speak up at any time and engage in intense debate and discussion of key ideas and their expression.\n\nStep 6: Iterative Refinement Process\n16\\. Incorporate the feedback received during the meeting into another draft of the PR and FAQ documents.\n17\\. Present the revised documents to the group for further review and discussion, repeating the process of refinement and feedback iteration.\n18\\. Continuously test and strengthen the proposal through multiple iterations, ensuring that all concerns are addressed and the concept gains clarity and alignment among stakeholders.\n\nStep 7: Alignment and Approval\n19\\. Seek final approval from decision-makers once the project proposal has undergone sufficient refinement and alignment.\n20\\. Confirm that all stakeholders, from the project proposer to the CEO, share a clear understanding of the project's goals and vision.\n21\\. Ensure that everyone is on the same page from the beginning, thanks to the participatory process involving relevant individuals deeply engaged throughout the project.\n\nBy following this business process, Amazon ensures that project proposals are developed with a customer-focused approach and refined through iterative feedback and discussion. The use of plain language and intense scrutiny helps uncover flaws and improve clarity. This participatory process ensures alignment among stakeholders and increases the chances of successfully executing projects that meet customer needs and fulfill organizational goals.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"646e872703e178789264beb1","name":"How Big Things Get Done","idShort":210,"shortLink":"9tEAhFsw"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-05-28T18:45:34.998Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"64701e51df31e839b3676be7","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"“What is this project about?,” he asks himself. “What is its point?” He forces himself to “boil the project down to three paragraphs, or two, or one.”[16] These paragraphs express the narrative theme with perfect simplicity.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"646e872703e178789264beb1","name":"How Big Things Get Done","idShort":210,"shortLink":"9tEAhFsw"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-05-26T02:49:53.809Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"64701e29ac3734bae563c68b","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Asking “Why?” can work only where people feel free to speak their minds and the decision makers really listen.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"646e872703e178789264beb1","name":"How Big Things Get Done","idShort":210,"shortLink":"9tEAhFsw"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-05-26T02:49:13.511Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"64701e1187fc64018555e221","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The most common way in which thinking from right to left fails is losing sight of the right, the goal.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"646e872703e178789264beb1","name":"How Big Things Get Done","idShort":210,"shortLink":"9tEAhFsw"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-05-26T02:48:49.017Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"64701e017043ab27464b8e6a","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"“Backcasting” is used in urban and environmental planning.

Leading up the chain of command requires tactful engagement with the immediate boss (or in military terms, higher headquarters) to obtain the decisions and support necessary to enable your team to accomplish its mission and ultimately win. To do this, a leader must push situational awareness up the chain of command. Leading up the chain takes much more savvy and skill than leading down the chain. Leading up, the leader cannot fall back on his or her positional authority. Instead, the subordinate leader must use influence, experience, knowledge, communication, and maintain the highest professionalism. While pushing to make your superior understand what you need, you must also realize that your boss must allocate limited assets and make decisions with the bigger picture in mind. You and your team may not represent the priority effort at that particular time. Or perhaps the senior leadership has chosen a different direction. Have the humility to understand and accept this.

In the paper “Storyboarding for Visual Analytics”, Rick Walker et al. (2013) explore the components of storyboarding language: composition, viewpoint, progress, annotability and interactivity.\n\nProgress is how transitions occur between frames. Print, web, exploratory and explanatory information design all require consideration for how one piece of data rolls into the next. Fading or zooming in, turning a page, scrolling or a pop-up should be planned and integrated seamlessly into the narrative experience. If a motion is involved, that should be indicated through annotation or a written description to represent elements and details that don’t translate well to the storyboard frames themselves.\n\nComposition refers to what information is included in a given frame. Viewpoint refers to the type of shot or angle represented in a frame – wide-angle for the start of a progression, and full-shot or close-up for a zoomed-in, more focused view of a specific area or thing. The mantra of overview first, zoom and filter, and then details on demand fit well with displaying information design.\n\nProgress is how transitions occur between frames. Print, web, exploratory and explanatory information design all require consideration for how one piece of data rolls into the next. Fading or zooming in, turning a page, scrolling or a pop-up should be planned and integrated seamlessly into the narrative experience. If a motion is involved, that should be indicated through annotation or a written description to represent elements and details that don’t translate well to the storyboard frames themselves.\n\nExplanatory narratives rely mostly on a traditional linear story structure to resonate and keep the viewer’s interest. The narrative structure takes hints from Freytag’s model, with a set-up, rising action, climax, falling action and conclusion.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"64442d0eecc25beb116a7509","name":"Information Design for the Common

What you want to say is: here’s the destination in all its glory and here are rules for getting there.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"63c5f19a8e826a0389e8961f","name":"Flock not Clock","idShort":202,"shortLink":"SRuY7hBm"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-01-17T01:40:12.891Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"63c5fb5eb9f76900ba1cfc47","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The second thing to remember about planning is that if planning is a line, made up of some number of points, there are two points on that line that are the most important to clarify with your team: Be brutally honest about where you are—your starting point—and be crystal clear about where you want to go—your ending point or goal.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"63c5f19a8e826a0389e8961f","name":"Flock not Clock","idShort":202,"shortLink":"SRuY7hBm"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-01-17T01:35:26.375Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"63c5f9c9afd58602fb0d6d36","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"“Life is what happens when you are making other plans.” So, first and foremost, we must remember that plans are merely mental models about the future and how it will play out, and we must ensure that we update those plans constantly as we get new feedback, information, or signals from the real world.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"63c5f19a8e826a0389e8961f","name":"Flock not Clock","idShort":202,"shortLink":"SRuY7hBm"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-01-17T01:28:41.052Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"63c5f8a98eaadd00276b95f9","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Traditional “Clockwork” Leadership 1.

works as a signalling device because of a simple cost-benefit analysis.

For the same advertising expense, a firm selling a low-quality product can get only one-off purchases from first-time customers.

These are games of incomplete information, where players are uncertain about the characteristics of the other player and so are uncertain about the payoffs from the possible outcomes of the game. Often this is represented by thinking of the other player as having a type. Each type is associated with different payoffs from the possible outcomes of the game. A player typically knows his or her own type, but it is unknown to the other player. Hence there is asymmetric information.\n\nIt is difficult for an individual consumer to discern the quality of a product before purchasing it. However, the company has a good idea whether its product is likely to be long-lasting or not.

Base the choice among current options much more on their long-term costs and benefits, not just the results they will produce in today’s market or tomorrow’s election. Develop the incentives, the tools, and the procedures required for the media, the market, and elections to report, respect, and be responsible for issues that unfold over decades. \n• Improve the signals. Learn more about and monitor both the real welfare of the human population and the real impact on the world ecosystem of human activity.6 Inform governments and the public as continuously and promptly about environmental and social conditions as about economic conditions. Include environmental and social costs in economic prices; recast economic indicators such as the GDP, so that they do not confuse costs with benefits or throughput with welfare or the deterioration of natural capital with income. \n• Speed up response times. Look actively for signals that indicate when the environment or society is stressed. Decide in advance what to do if problems appear (if possible, forecast them before they appear) and have in place the institutional and technical arrangements necessary to act effectively. Educate for flexibility and creativity, for critical thinking and the ability to redesign both physical and social systems. Computer modeling can help with this step, but equally important would be general education in systems thinking. \n• Minimize the use of nonrenewable resources. Fossil fuels, fossil groundwaters, and minerals should be used only with the greatest possible efficiency, recycled when possible (fuels can’t be recycled, but minerals and water can), and consumed only as part of a deliberate transition to renewable resources. • Prevent the erosion of renewable resources. The productivity of soils, surface waters, rechargeable groundwaters, and all living things, including forests, fish, and game should be protected and, as far as possible, restored and enhanced. These resources should only be harvested at the rate at which they can regenerate themselves. That requires information about their regeneration rates and strong social sanctions or economic inducements against their overuse. \n• Use all resources with maximum efficiency. The more human welfare can be obtained within a given ecological footprint, the better the quality of life can be while remaining below the limits. Great efficiency gains are both technically possible and economically favorable. 7 Higher efficiency will be essential, if the current world population and economy are to get back down below the limits without inducing a collapse. \n• Slow and eventually stop exponential growth of population and physical capital. There are limits to the extent that the first six items on this list can be pursued. Therefore this last item is the most essential. It involves institutional and philosophical change and social innovation. It requires defining levels of population and industrial output that are desirable and sustainable. It calls for defining goals around the idea of development rather than growth. It asks, simply but profoundly, for a larger and more truly satisfying vision of the purpose of human existence than mere physical expansion and accumulation.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"60f19c715542a3764af08f5e","name":"Limits to Growth","idShort":150,"shortLink":"vAog13wK"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2023-01-06T01:24:55.204Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-01-06T01:23:55.954Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"63b776661a60d60060721f2d","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The word equilibrium in systems language means that positive and negative loops are in balance and that the system’s major stocks—","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"60f19c715542a3764af08f5e","name":"Limits to Growth","idShort":150,"shortLink":"vAog13wK"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-01-06T01:16:22.605Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"63b7742dd5393a0378e5ca4b","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Delays in market and technology responses can be much longer than economic theories or mental models expect.

(Here there is usually an admission that the market needs significant correction in order to reflect the cost of “externalities” like pollution.) \n• The rising price generates responses. It pays geologists to go find more of the resource, or biologists to breed more, or chemists to synthesize it. It causes manufacturers to substitute a more abundant resource for the scarce one and to rely more on recycling. It forces consumers to use fewer products containing the resource or to use the resource more efficiently. It induces engineers to develop pollution control devices, or to find places to sequester the pollutant, or to invent manufacturing processes that don’t produce the pollutant in the first place. \n• These responses on both the demand and the supply side compete in the market, where the interplay of buyers and sellers decides which technologies and consumption patterns solve the problem most quickly and efficiently at least cost. \n• Eventually the problem is “solved.” The system has overcome that particular scarcity or reduced the damage from that pollutant. • All this is feasible at a cost society is willing to pay and occurs quickly enough to avoid irremediable damage.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"60f19c715542a3764af08f5e","name":"Limits to Growth","idShort":150,"shortLink":"vAog13wK"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2023-01-06T00:52:56.738Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2023-01-06T00:52:09.120Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"63b76f71117bc100d7c88bd8","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The most common criticisms of the original World3 model were that it underestimated the power of technology and that it did not represent adequately the adaptive resilience of the free market.

positions emerge from three distinct sources, which are not mutually exclusive and often overlap. \n\nFirst, positioning can be based on producing a subset of an industry’s products or services. I call this variety-based positioning because it is based on the choice of product or service varieties rather than customer segments. Variety-based positioning makes economic sense when a company can best produce particular products or services using distinctive sets of activities.\n\nA second basis for positioning is that of serving most or all the needs of a particular group of customers. I call this needs-based positioning, which comes closer to traditional thinking about targeting a segment of customers. It arises when there are groups of customers with differing needs, and when a tailored set of activities can serve those needs best. Some groups of customers are more price sensitive than others, demand different product features, and need varying amounts of information, support, and services.\n\nA variant of needs-based positioning arises when the same customer has different needs on different occasions or for different types of transactions. The same person, for example, may have different needs when traveling on business than when traveling for pleasure with the family.\n\nIt is intuitive for most managers to conceive of their business in terms of the customers’ needs they are meeting. But a critical element of needs-based positioning is not at all intuitive and is often overlooked. Differences in needs will not translate into meaningful positions unless the best set of activities to satisfy them also differs. If that were not the case, every competitor could meet those same needs, and there would be nothing unique or valuable about the positioning.\n\nThe third basis for positioning is that of segmenting customers who are accessible in different ways. Although their needs are similar to those of other customers, the best configuration of activities to reach them is different. I call this access-based positioning. Access can be a function of customer geography or customer scale—or of anything that requires a different set of activities to reach customers in the best way.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"637cee43f8dff0027a0d6af9","name":"HBR's 10 Must Reads On Strategy","idShort":199,"shortLink":"0jJZQFvQ"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5aa80ac327f5e64713d8a63b","name":"What I've Started To Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2022-11-22T16:16:21.363Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"637cf0343da9b701c28dc563","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Trade-offs arise for three reasons.\n\nThe first is inconsistencies in image or reputation. A company known for delivering one kind of value may lack credibility and confuse customers—or even undermine its reputation—if it delivers another kind of value or attempts to deliver two inconsistent things at the same time.\n\nSecond, and more important, trade-offs arise from activities themselves. Different positions (with their tailored activities) require different product configurations, different equipment, different employee behavior, different skills, and different management systems. Many trade-offs reflect inflexibilities in machinery, people, or systems.\n\n\nFinally, trade-offs arise from limits on internal coordination and control. By clearly choosing to compete in one way and not another, senior management makes organizational priorities clear. Companies that try to be all things to all customers, in contrast, risk confusion in the trenches as employees attempt to make day-to-day operating decisions without a clear framework.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"637cee43f8dff0027a0d6af9","name":"HBR's 10 Must Reads On Strategy","idShort":199,"shortLink":"0jJZQFvQ"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5aa80ac327f5e64713d8a63b","name":"What I've Started To Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2022-11-22T15:52:20.286Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"637cee937d011e03d412d851","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Operational effectiveness (OE) means performing similar activities better than rivals perform them.

One of the key findings of prospect theory is loss aversion, recognizing that the emotional impact of a loss is greater than the corresponding impact of an equivalent gain. In fact, losing feels about two times as bad to us as winning feels good to us. When we’re choosing among new options, loss aversion causes us to favor the ones that have the lowest absolute loss associated with them, even if those options come at a lower expected value. In other words, our aversion to taking a loss causes us to make decisions a rational actor would not.\n\nDuke, Annie. Quit (p. 52). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. \n\nDuke, Annie.

The product of this analysis and synthesis is a defined mismatch between what we expect to happen and what we observe is actually happening. This mismatch prompts us to DECIDE what to do to eliminate the mismatch. And finally, we ACT on that decision. What makes this a loop, however, is that we go back and observe the effects of our action on reality: did our action reduce the size of the gap? If so, was it enough? If not, what can we do differently? For most people in our day-to-day lives, this decision process takes place intuitively, often in a matter of seconds. In many cases, following this loop informally and intuitively works just fine. But in complicated systems operating in complex environments, what appears to be the problem isn’t always the end of the story. Often what we actually see is the effect of a number of underlying causes that might not be obvious to the casual observer. More often than not, the real underlying cause of this gap between reality and expectations lies several layers of cause-and-effect below the visible level. Acting on an erroneous conclusion about what’s causing the divergence from the strategy can produce even more turbulence in an already beleaguered system, not to mention incurring more unplanned costs. This risk makes it even more critical to ensure that leaders take the right action to close the gap between what is and what should be.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"5b6343577ed0460c8392e242","name":"The Logical Thinking Process","idShort":18,"shortLink":"sU8AeozS"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading

Logical Thinking Process is based on five key principles: \n\nFirst, Aristotle‘s principle of valid deduction, or syllogism, that is, the requirement that the assumptions behind a conclusion are sufficient.\n\nSecondly, the framework requires necessity logic when this is applicable.\n\nThird, the Logical Thinking Process requires us to verify the validity of the statements we make; it is not enough to have sound cause-effect relationship between entities, you must also verify their existence, or validity.\n\nFourth, the Logical Thinking Process requires us to verify possible explanations by demonstrating that not only the effect we seek to explain exists, but also that other effects that should lead from the cause proposed, actually do exist.\n\nFinally, clarity is really the cornerstone of every step in the Logical Thinking Process. The first question we must always ask is not only if our statements are true, but also if they are clear. What do we really mean? Does the statement reflect what we really mean? Is there any ambiguity in the statement? And if there is, we must fix that before moving on.\n\n\nSiglaugsson, Thorsteinn.

That is a lot of risk, and it adds up over the complete scope of requirements. We must manage this risk—ideally by conducting low-cost experiments to gain information. If it turns out that the hypothesis is not confirmed, then we can pivot and work with a more promising hypothesis.

In order to reduce the ecological footprint of humanity, it would seem reasonable that every society should make improvements where it has the most opportunity to do so. The South has the most room for improvement in P, the West has the most room for improvement in A, while Eastern Europe has the most room for improvement in T.\n\nAffluence is determined by a high rate of consumption; for example, the number of hours spent watching television, driving a car, or relaxing in a room. The ecological footprint of affluence is the impact or throughput generated by the material, energy, and emissions associated with this consumption. For instance, if one drinks three servings of coffee per day, the footprint can be widely different depending on whether traditional china or plastic cups are used. Maintaining the china cups takes water and soap to wash them and a small flow of cups to replace annual breakage. If a person uses and discards polystyrene cups, on the other hand, the maintenance flow includes all the cups used in a year as well as the petroleum and chemicals needed to make the polystyrene and transport the cups to their point of use.\n\nThe impact of technology is defined in table 3-3 as the energy needed to make and deliver each material flow, multiplied by the environmental impact per unit of energy. It takes energy to mine the clay for ceramic cups, to fire the clay, to deliver the cups to the household, and to heat the water to wash them. It takes energy to find and pump the oil for polystyrene cups, to transport the oil, run the refinery, form the polymer, mold the cups, deliver the cups, and transport the used cups to the dump. Each kind of energy has its environmental impact. The ecological footprint can be technologically changed with pollution control devices, with energy efficiency changes, or by switching to another energy source.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"60f19c715542a3764af08f5e","name":"Limits to Growth","idShort":150,"shortLink":"vAog13wK"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"},"dateLastEdited":"2021-12-18T17:13:02.934Z"},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-12-18T17:10:33.140Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"61be15affa2d396a7b724dd9","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The continued poverty of the majority of the planet’s inhabitants and excessive consumption by the minority are the two major causes of environmental degradation.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"60f19c715542a3764af08f5e","name":"Limits to Growth","idShort":150,"shortLink":"vAog13wK"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d793c2f0294c72f1b33","name":"What's Actively Being Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-12-18T17:09:03.673Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"61be158609976f38b4212683","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"The reasons for avoiding the issue of overshoot are understandable and political. Any talk of reducing growth feeds into a bitter argument about distribution—of available resources and of responsibility for the current state of affairs.

One German, the saying goes, has a footprint 10 times that of a Mozambiquean, while one Russian draws as many resources from the planet as one German—without even getting a decent standard of living out of it. If the world as a whole is exceeding its limits, who should do something about it: the wasteful rich or the multiplying poor or inefficient ex-socialists?

These differences fundamentally affect the forms of integration each can support, including the coupling between producer and consumer.\n\nEventing is the other key form of streaming applications is one in which information is transmitted, but little or no feedback is required from the consumers to the producer. This pattern is one that focuses on signaling facts, and is most commonly applied to things like alerting, notifications, simple state updates, and other situations where the producer simply needs to provide data, but can ignore the state or activity of consumers in response.\n\nUrquhart, James.

One such option is to minimize the network segments (or “hops”) that an event must traverse before reaching its destination.\n\nDirectly connecting a producer to a consumer through a single local network segment is the fastest way to do this over a network, but that is impractical for integrating applications between disparate organizations. So, the next best thing appears to be to arrange to connect the consumer’s software as “close” to the producer as possible, in terms of network hops. One way to do that is to select a data center that is physically near the producer’s data center (or even within the producer’s data center, as is commonly done for HFT applications), and to connect via network options that minimize hops. The industry is already adopting this option for a variety of IoT and industrial use cases. The term edge computing describes the pattern of placing processing on systems as close to sources and/or sinks as possible.\n\nUrquhart, James. Flow Architectures . O'Reilly Media.

And it turns out that remembering the future is a better way to plan for it. From the vantage point of the present, it’s hard to see past the next step. We end up over-planning for addressing problems we have right now. Implicit in that approach is the assumption that conditions will remain the same, facts won’t change, and the paradigm will remain stable.

For example, listen for the things you agree with, state those and be specific, and then follow with “and” instead of “but.” If there is one thing we have learned thus far it is that we like having our ideas affirmed. If we want to engage someone with whom we have some disagreement (inside or outside our group), they will be more open and less defensive if we start with those areas of agreement, which there surely will be. It is rare that we disagree with everything that someone has to say. By putting into practice the strategies that promote universalism, actively looking for the ideas that we agree with, we will more naturally engage people in the process of learning with us. We will also be more open-minded to what others have to say as well, enhancing our ability to calibrate our own beliefs. When we lead with assent, our listeners will be more open to any dissent that might follow. In addition, when the new information is presented as supplementing rather than negating what has come before, our listeners will be much more open to what we have to say. The simplest rhetorical touches can make a difference. If someone expresses a belief or prediction that doesn’t sound well calibrated and we have relevant information, try to say and, as in, “I agree with you that [insert specific concepts and ideas we agree with], AND . . .” After “and,” add the additional information. In the same exchange, if we said, “I agree with you that [insert specific concepts and ideas you agree with], BUT . . . ,” that challenge puts people on the defensive. “And” is an offer to contribute. “But” is a denial and repudiation of what came before.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"6188a47ac6ac9988f2adf9bc","name":"Think in Bets","idShort":173,"shortLink":"EO4CqFA9"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d01415911312d21de3f","name":"What To Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-12-04T20:40:51.316Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"61abd17b21d5b01297033fc7","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"First, express uncertainty.

Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition is a framework that outlines how people progress through different stages of learning as they acquire new skills. It was developed by brothers Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus in the 1980s. The model describes five stages of skill acquisition, moving from novice to expert. Here's a summary of each stage:\n\n1. Novice: At this stage, learners have little to no experience and rely on rules or guidelines provided to them. They focus on learning simple tasks without understanding the bigger picture.\n\n\n2. Advanced Beginner: Learners start recognizing patterns and applying guidelines in different situations. They still follow rules but can handle slightly more complex tasks with some help.\n\n\n3. Competent: At this point, learners can plan and make decisions on their own. They can handle more responsibility, develop routines, and start understanding the broader context of their tasks, but they still think in a structured, rule-based way.\n\n\n4. Proficient: Learners gain deeper understanding and experience. They see the big picture, can adapt to different situations, and use intuition to solve problems, but still consciously reflect on decisions.\n\n\n5. Expert: At the expert level, learners rely on intuition and deep knowledge to make decisions effortlessly. They know what to do in almost any situation without needing to think about rules or guidelines, and they can handle complex situations fluidly.\n\n\n\nThe Dreyfus model emphasizes that skill acquisition is a gradual process, with each stage requiring different learning approaches and experiences.\n\n","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"61577f504a37ee110a00bab7","name":"From Novice to Expert","idShort":169,"shortLink":"kVRVOs0d"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"6157707bce9a7880ba94e147","name":"Books from 2017 and Before"},"dateLastEdited":"2024-09-29T16:49:46.056Z"},"appCreator":null,"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-10-01T21:43:10.812Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"61577f504a37ee110a00baba","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"card":{"id":"61577f504a37ee110a00bab7","name":"From Novice to Expert","idShort":169,"shortLink":"kVRVOs0d"},"list":{"id":"6157707bce9a7880ba94e147","name":"Books from 2017 and Before"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"createCard","date":"2021-10-01T21:36:16.250Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"61577f37801a8f21e5b3856c","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"card":{"id":"61577f37801a8f21e5b38569","name":"The Pragmatic Programmer","idShort":168,"shortLink":"jfb1WE4d"},"list":{"id":"6157707bce9a7880ba94e147","name":"Books from 2017 and Before"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"createCard","date":"2021-10-01T21:35:51.573Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"615776274b704104d789e9e2","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"4 types of Complexity\n- Imposed - Forced laws and regulations.

Management sets them at the company level, employees at the departmental level. In general, these committed objectives—such as sales and revenue goals—are to be achieved in full (100 percent) within a set time frame. \n\nAspirational objectives reflect bigger-picture, higher-risk, more future-tilting ideas. They originate from any tier and aim to mobilize the entire organization. By definition, they are challenging to achieve. Failures—at an average rate of 40 percent—are part of Google’s territory. \n\nThe relative weighting of these two baskets is a cultural question. It will vary from one organization to the next, and from quarter to quarter. Leaders must ask themselves: What type of company do we need to be in the coming year? Agile and daring, to crack a new market—or more conservative and operational, to firm up our existing position? Are we in survival mode, or is there cash on hand to bet big for a big reward?

This makes you incredibly valuable in the job market and irreplaceable on a social and personal level.\n\nThe first step in defining your skill stack is making sure you have abilities that work as counterparts and complement each other toward a specific end goal.\n","card":{"id":"60c0caf77fb77b29b5b26289","name":"Polymath","idShort":145,"shortLink":"U8eJk3bm"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5fea28dfe993352e724dc330","name":"2021 Books Completed "}},"appCreator":null,"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-09-03T03:08:06.282Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"612f975fcdc2a38e9af34102","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s91/sh/c6e298f0-3871-29c2-64f2-182f069e727a/1a07c279d38dff8f9e8d762ab267ca45","card":{"id":"60c0c9ee414fe58b16213714","name":"Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy","idShort":142,"shortLink":"gacCCfYr"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d01415911312d21de3f","name":"What To Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-09-01T15:08:15.587Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"612f9747efb383877fc1f36b","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s91/sh/e1de89fb-0301-ee6e-2380-4bda9acc9308/4f30384fef8e971ba0abf841b22fdcd9","card":{"id":"60c0c9ee414fe58b16213714","name":"Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy","idShort":142,"shortLink":"gacCCfYr"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d01415911312d21de3f","name":"What To Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-09-01T15:07:51.459Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"612f972fd7827a20bedc79c1","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s91/sh/5ad8e76a-ec76-4fd8-021a-33c62b4a40f9/8168ece27dfa511eb1fbef914fadcec6","card":{"id":"60c0c9ee414fe58b16213714","name":"Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy","idShort":142,"shortLink":"gacCCfYr"},"board":{"id":"5b758e01203dc37020232fb2","name":"Reading List","shortLink":"r6MMYk8s"},"list":{"id":"5a6a3d01415911312d21de3f","name":"What To Read"}},"appCreator":{"id":"4f2e03c573c9e4eb241b1e1b"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2021-09-01T15:07:27.356Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257/2acc86373de3fb44e24b0389d510d881","fullName":"Chris Gianelle","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"CG","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Chris Gianelle","initials":"CG","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"chrisgianelle1"}},{"id":"6126796303879e8e0a586e7e","idMemberCreator":"53792f70fc2cb09e503f4257","data":{"text":"Set goals from the bottom up.

1**: Architect products; evolve from projects to products. Architecting products is more efficient than just designing point solutions to projects and focuses the team on its customers.\n\n**Principle 2**: Focus on quality attributes, not on functional requirements. Quality attribute requirements drive the architecture.\n\n**Principle 3**: Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary. Design architectures based on facts, not on guesses. There is no point in designing and implementing capabilities that may never be used—it is a waste of time and resources.\n\n**Principle 4**: Architect for change—leverage the “power of small.” Big, monolithic, tightly coupled components are hard to change. Instead, leverage small, loosely coupled software elements.\n\n**Principle 5**: Architect for build, test, deploy, and operate. Most architecture methodologies focus exclusively on software building activities, but we believe that architects should be concerned about testing, deployment, and operation, too, in order to support continuous delivery.\n\n**Principle 6**: Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on. The way teams are organized drives the architecture and design of the systems they are working on.\n\nWoods, Eoin; Erder, Murat; Pureur, Pierre.

best-performing SEAL units had leaders who accepted responsibility for everything. Every mistake, every failure or shortfall—those leaders would own it. During the debrief after a training mission, those good SEAL leaders took ownership of failures, sought guidance on how to improve, and figured out a way to overcome challenges on the next iteration. The best leaders checked their egos, accepted blame, sought out constructive criticism, and took detailed notes for improvement.\n\nWillink, Jocko; Babin, Leif. Extreme Ownership (p. 37).

to flourish, the two primary parties in the connection — the producer and the consumer — must be confident that they will be able to exchange data as promised. There are actually two parts to this problem, as we saw consistently with the protocols we explored in Chapter 4. The first is the event metadata, the problem of understanding the context around the event: what is included, how is it encoded, where did it come from, and so on. The second is the event payload, the actual data of the event: a new value, the difference (or “delta”) from a previous value, an updated object (like a document), and so on.\n\nUrquhart, James.
